            <h1>Mayon Volcano</h1>
            <h2>Albay, Bicol</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Mayon Volcano is located in the province of Albay in the Bicol region of the Philippines. It is situated approximately 10 kilometers north of Legazpi City, the capital of Albay, and is easily recognizable due to its perfect, symmetrical cone shape. The volcano is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region known for its seismic activity, and is one of the most famous natural landmarks in the Philippines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Mayon Volcano is an active stratovolcano, with the most recent eruption occurring in 2018. The volcano's history is marked by frequent eruptions, with over 50 eruptions recorded over the past 400 years. The earliest eruptions date back to 1616. Mayon is owned by the Philippine government, but its surrounding areas are managed by local authorities and the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), which monitors its activity. The area around the volcano is also home to several indigenous communities who have lived there for centuries.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I consider it a memorable place. We went back to our province Bicol, to visit some of our relatives that were still there. We also went there for vacation. We went past the volcano and I was really amazed when I first saw the it, the volcano's sheer size and perfect shape amazed me and inspired me to explore more places.</p>
